# The First Church of Quibs

Our church is a proud supporter of *free and open source software* (FOSS). To demonstrate our commitment, we have developed our entire website
publicly and made it available on Github.

## Technologies that make our Church possible:

* node.js
* express.js
* jade
* peg.js
* socket.io
* jquery (and many great plugins such as History and gritter)
* chart.js
* supersized
* mysql
* SCEditor
* node-canvas
* recaptcha

## Where's the DB schema? (Pronounced, "skee-ma", not "shem-ah")

Coming soon.
